p tag is block element
a tag is an inline element

every tag has a default margin and padding,in order to 
eliminate the default margin and padding,we do This
*{
    padding:0;
    margin:0
}

inline elements like
 <span></span><i></i><a></a><b></b><strong></strong>

display:inline
and the display is inline then it 
flows from left to right , they consider
left and right margin and padding if given ,
they ignore the top and the bottom margin and padding ,even
if it is given,
they only consider the left and right margin and padding
inline elements consider as per to the size of the content
inline elements does nt take the external width,if defined
it takes only the space i.e the width , the content is taking
in order to make the inline elements or the inline styling
consider to the width and height property ,we make 
it inline-block


whereas block elements like
h1 to h6, p, div, form, header, footer,they consider the
top and bottom margin and padding, by default and
also while  given to them
they move from top and bottom

we are treating img as inlne block elements
img is an inline-block
inline-block elements allow us to set width height to it 
but it does nt goes to the next line 
inline-block elements doe snot go to the next line 
Also, with display: inline-block , the top and bottom margins/paddings are
respected, but with display: inline they are not.

display:none; it removes the element from the html tree

float is used to align the inline elements right or left,
as the the inline element moves from left to right , it helps in 
positioning them



/* inline-block and float does not in  the same class */

/* overflow-x: scroll;
    overflow-y: auto; */
/* same as the above */
    overflow: scroll auto; same as above

in order to break the css normal flow we use css position property
