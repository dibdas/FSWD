    create-react-app is a package made by react developers, it creates the boilerplate react code
    npm is used to install manage or delete the packages
    npx is used to run the package
    node_modules - install the packages the which is used by the react, it consists of built-in code..
    index.html is first file to load in react..
    all the react code will enter into the <div id="root"></div>
    in react parent of all the element and div is root div
    Rule of JSX there should be one top level element in JSX
    JSX will have only one root level element
    not acceptable the below line two top level elements <h1></h1>and <p></p>
    const myHello = <h1>HEllo there I am in JSX!..</h1><p>hi.....</p>
    one top level element i.e <div></div>
    const myHello = <div><h1>HEllo there I am in JSX!..</h1><p>hi.....there</p></div>

    use paranthesis i.e() to use multiline statements

    JSX will transform to JS elements , className will convert to class

    {
        /* <h1></h1><p></p> these are known as React elements */
      }
      // myHello as a whole is a JSX Element, even p and h1 is also React element

      // React elements areimmutable

      JSX does allow to write if else statements

       functions return the JSX elements becomes a component

       <React.StrictMode> is used because , it let you know about the bug in the code ,
        before sending it to the production
     StrictMode gives you the warning in the development mode, while in the production mode shows the error

     use rfce for code snippets

     put the cursor beside the component then press crt +space press enter ,import statement
      will be written at the above automatically

      <h1>state, hooks</h1>
      useState create a state object and it return two values in an array ,
            useState returns an Array


    when you call setcount function is called, the component is called again, it gets mounted
    the previous component is removed, a new component is made with same name  , and the same thing happens again
    and count gets increased


    useState is actaully defining the function setCount and we are just calling it
  by doing it setCount(count+1) and returning from  let [count, setCount] = useState(0);



// when you call setcount function is called, the component is called again,
//  i.e it gets re-rendered it gets mounted and the previous component is removed
// i.e unmounted from the DOM, a new component is made with same
//  name is created , and the same thing happens again again we get the count variable
// and setCount but the count value has changed , it gets the updated value
// all the update operation are done in the virtual DOM,
// setCount is creating another component ,when it is called and the new value is assined to
// count variable
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
count=count+1 // not allowed , as it is trying to change the vale of const variable
setCount(count+1) // setCount is creating another component with updateed value of count

// state variable can retains its value and it can re-render the entire component


Component get unmouted two times , while re-rendering and moving from one page to another ...

mounting->updating->unmounting->re-rendering->remounting
