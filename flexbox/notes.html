Notice that when the flex direction is a column, justify-content changes to the vertical and 
align-items to the horizontal.

Sometimes reversing the row or column order of a container is not enough. In these cases, 
we can apply the order property to individual items. By default, items have a value of 0, 
but we can use this property to also set it to a positive or negative integer value (-2, -1, 0, 1, 2).

Use the order property to reorder the frogs according to their lilypads.
(-2, -1, 0, 1, 2).
moving th element to the right side is denoted by positive number , moving th element to the left by (-tive)
#pond {
    display: flex;
  }
  
  .yellow {
  order:2
  }


  #pond {
    display: flex;
  }
  
  .red {
  order:-2
  }


  Another property you can apply to individual items is align-self. 
  This property accepts the same values as align-items and its value for the specific item.

  #pond {
    display: flex;
    align-items: flex-start;
  }
  
  .yellow {
  align-self:flex-end
  }

  Combine order with align-self to help the frogs to their destinations.
  #pond {
    display: flex;
    align-items: flex-start;
  }
  
  .yellow {
  order:1;
  align-self:flex-end
  }



  Oh no! The frogs are all squeezed onto a single row of lilypads. Spread them out using the 
  flex-wrap property, which accepts the following values:

nowrap: Every item is fit to a single line.
wrap: Items wrap around to additional lines.
wrap-reverse: Items wrap around to additional lines in reverse.

#pond {
    display: flex;
  flex-wrap:wrap;
  }

  Help this army of frogs form three orderly columns using a combination of flex-direction 
  and flex-wrap.

  #pond {
    display: flex;
  flex-direction:column;
  flex-wrap:wrap;
  }

The two properties flex-direction and flex-wrap are used so often together that the shorthand 
property flex-flow was created to combine them. This shorthand property accepts the value of the 
two properties separated by a space.

For example, you can use flex-flow: row wrap to set rows and wrap them.

Try using flex-flow to repeat the previous level.

#pond {
    display: flex;
  flex-flow:column wrap
  }


The frogs are spread all over the pond, but the lilypads are bunched at the top. 
You can use align-content to set how multiple lines are spaced apart from each other.
 This property takes the following values:

flex-start: Lines are packed at the top of the container.
flex-end: Lines are packed at the bottom of the container.
center: Lines are packed at the vertical center of the container.
space-between: Lines display with equal spacing between them.
space-around: Lines display with equal spacing around them.
stretch: Lines are stretched to fit the container.

This can be confusing, but align-content determines the spacing between lines, 
while align-items determines how the items as a whole are aligned within the container. 
When there is only one line, align-content has no effect.

#pond {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
  align-content:flex-start;
  }


  #pond {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
  align-content:flex-end;
  }


  The frogs have had a party, but it is time to go home. Use a combination of flex-direction and 
  align-content to get them to their lilypads.

  #pond {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
  flex-direction:column-reverse;
  align-content:center;
  }
