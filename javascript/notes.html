html is mark up language language, html actually tells the text in which format text is supposed to work
text are given markup such h1 ,p li ,ul 
h1 is the heading, p is paragraph li is the list of the item ....

CSS can also be said as mark up language

JavaScript is an interpreted language, not a compiled language. A program such as C++ or Java needs 
to be compiled before it is run. The source code is passed through a program called a compiler, 
which translates it into bytecode that the machine understands and can execute


JS is a single threaded and single concurrent programming language which means it can handle one 
task at a time or, in other words, a piece of code at a time. It’s an interpreted programming 
language, and like most scripting languages, it uses dynamic typing, where type safety is verified
at the runtime. 

JavaScript is meant for writing code and run in web browsers i.e client..Nodejs was built so that the 
browser language can afford backend..

Java Script is an OOP scripting language

What is scripting language and example?
Image result for what is scripting language
A scripting language is a programming language that is interpreted. It is translated into machine 
code when the code is run, rather than beforehand. Scripting languages are often used for short 
scripts over full computer programs. JavaScript, Python, and Ruby, jQuery are all examples of scripting 
languages.

What is called compiler?
A compiler is a special program that translates a programming language's source code into machine code,
bytecode or another programming language. The source code is typically written in a high-level, 
human-readable language such as Java or C++.

Is SQL a scripting language?
SQL is a fourth-generation language, meaning it is a scripting language that does not require compiling 
to run. Like most fourth-generation languages, SQL requires an interpreter that translates rather than 
compiles code. As with all languages, SQL has rules for issuing commands and queries.



A compiler translates the entire source code in a single run. An interpreter translates the entire 
source code line by line. It consumes less time i.e., it is faster than an interpreter. It consumes 
much more time than the compiler i.e., it is slower than the compiler.
Perl, Ruby, PHP use Interpreters.
Java, Scala, C#, C, C++ use Compilers.


Python is an interpreted language, which means the source code of a Python program is converted into
bytecode that is then executed by the Python virtual machine. Python is different from major compiled
languages, such as C and C + +, as Python code is not required to be built and linked like code for 
these languages.



Using the const keyword on a Javascript object becomes a bit confusing — can the object's 
properties and methods be changed once defined ?

Yes, properties and methods be changed for a const object.

A const declaration does not mean that the value of the variable cannot be changed. 
It just means that the variable identifier cannot be reassigned.

Primitive data types (Number, Boolean, String etc) are passed by value. 
The variable identifier holds the value, and since identifier cannot be changed for
 a const, it essentially means that the value cannot be changed here.

However complex data types such as objects and arrays are passed by reference. 
The variable identifier holds the reference, not the actual "value". So even if
 the object's properties and methods are altered, it does not change the actual reference.


Image result for primitive data types in javascript
Primitive data types are number, string, boolean, NULL, Infinity and symbol. 
Non-primitive data types is the object. The JavaScript arrays and functions are also 
objects.


Are primitive data types mutable in JavaScript?
In JavaScript, objects and arrays are mutable by default, but primitive values are not — 
once a primitive value is created,
it cannot be changed, although the variable that holds it may be reassigned.
