css is styling language 

JavaScript is an interpreted language, not a compiled language. A program such as C++ or Java needs 
to be compiled before it is run. The source code is passed through a program called a compiler, 
which translates it into bytecode that the machine understands and can execute


JS is a single threaded and single concurrent programming language which means it can handle one 
task at a time or, in other words, a piece of code at a time. Itâ€™s an interpreted programming 
language, and like most scripting languages, it uses dynamic typing, where type safety is verified
at the runtime. 

JavaScript is meant for writing code and run in web browsers i.e client..Nodejs was built so that the 
browser language can afford backend..

Java Script is an OOP scripting language

What is scripting language and example?
Image result for what is scripting language
A scripting language is a programming language that is interpreted. It is translated into machine 
code when the code is run, rather than beforehand. Scripting languages are often used for short 
scripts over full computer programs. JavaScript, Python, and Ruby, jQuery are all examples of scripting 
languages.

What is called compiler?
A compiler is a special program that translates a programming language's source code into machine code,
bytecode or another programming language. The source code is typically written in a high-level, 
human-readable language such as Java or C++.

Is SQL a scripting language?
SQL is a fourth-generation language, meaning it is a scripting language that does not require compiling 
to run. Like most fourth-generation languages, SQL requires an interpreter that translates rather than 
compiles code. As with all languages, SQL has rules for issuing commands and queries.



A compiler translates the entire source code in a single run. An interpreter translates the entire 
source code line by line. It consumes less time i.e., it is faster than an interpreter. It consumes 
much more time than the compiler i.e., it is slower than the compiler.
Perl, Ruby, PHP use Interpreters.
Java, Scala, C#, C, C++ use Compilers.


Python is an interpreted language, which means the source code of a Python program is converted into
bytecode that is then executed by the Python virtual machine. Python is different from major compiled
languages, such as C and C + +, as Python code is not required to be built and linked like code for 
these languages.
