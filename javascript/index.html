script can also be written before the body tag , but it is not recommended 
if script tag is above body tag then , if you try to access the html element from the js it will 
give the error, because html element not yet been declared

the website will become slow as you trying to load the script i.e  it will dowwnload and then run 
before rendering the html element
<script>
    let title="das"
    console.log(title)

</script>
<body>
    <h1>Hi </h1>
    <!-- by default display of the script is none -->
    <script>
        let name="das"
        console.log(name)

    </script>
    multiple script can be defined 
    <script src="script.js"></script>
    <script src="script2.js"></script>
    
</body>
</html>
