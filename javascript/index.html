script can also be written before the body tag , but it is not recommended 
if script tag is above body tag then , if you try to access the html element from the js it will 
give the error, because html element not yet been declared

if the script is define before the body tag the website will become slow as you trying to load 
the script i.e  it will download and then run before rendering the html elements
<script>
    let title="das"
    console.log(title)

</script>

<body>
    <h1 id="demo">Hi </h1>
    <!-- by default display of the script is none -->

    <p>
    recommended paractise-
    script tag or script file declaring after all the html elements being declared,so that no error 
    comes while accessing the html elements.. and no desired output wil be provided...
    website will be faster as script is defined after the decaling all the HTML elements


    to start the blank page write abount:blank in browser

    </p>
    <script>
        let value="123das"
        console.log(value)
    </script>
    <p>
    You can place any number of scripts in an HTML document.
    multiple script can be declared and will synchronously,
    1st internal script will run, 2nd script1 will run then script2 will run</p>
    <!-- <script src="script.js"></script> -->
    <script src="conditions.js"></script>
    <!-- <script src="input_output.js"></script> -->
    
</body>

<script>
    let name="das"
    console.log(name)
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "My First JavaScript, and Its quite good";
</script>
