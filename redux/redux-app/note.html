reducers are pure functions. not asyn functions
reducers are synchronous in nature , they give the output based on their input 
when we do the async function we actually do the side effects

middleware is between dispatch action and reducer
reducers are not allowed to do the async function so middleware will the async 
operation as soons as the action is dispatched


middleware will fetched the data from the server or the internet api, after that 
I will dispatch my own actions, such that all seems to be working 
synchronously to the reducers, then reducer will udate the store

async function so it dispatch the action to the middleware,asunc function like 
fetching the data from the server or the internet

if it synchronous function then it will go to the reducer
