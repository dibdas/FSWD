Singlethread is for synchronous operation
Gaming , video  editing , rendering this are CPU intensive work 
New thread means new resources ,new RAM should be allocated

#traditional resources
A server can handle multiple request
server has thread pool , it creates new thread whenever request comes to the server
New thread means new resources ,new different process, new RAM should be allocated , 
almost separated from the server ,and after fetching data from the server will provide to the request
when new request comes it creates new thread , then data is being fetched and send it to the request


Node server
when R1 i.e request1 or R2i.e request2 comes to node server it creates new threads and send to Linux
based server. where code is in C++..Node .js server creates new thread and after creating new thread it
spawn C++ thread, C++ fetch the data and send the response to the request made
Linux based OS threads are very fast , node js can access directly Os threads so fast and scalable..

Nodejs never blocks itself , therefore it is single threaded aand non-blocking

Event loop listen to new jobs coming to it , it checks how many jobs have come to it and listen to
what are the jobs have been completed and thats why it creates a complete loop.. ansychronous job
are done by the help of event loop

Synchronous jobs are completed by single thred

thread is a child of a process. One process can create multiple threads ,which  works asynchronously 
and it create response and send the reponse to the request

If you need to do (a+b) operation it also need to generate a process, one process can 
spawn multiple threads
One process can access multiple request and can spawn multiple threads ...

Single thread is a kind of resource where only synchronous work occurs..,metaphorically .., its a kind of
single road

when a request R1 comes to nodejs server , single thread does the synchronous work i.e 
the CPU intensive work, and for the asynchronous work it creates the C++ thread,basically the OS thread
C++ thread of R1 do the async work i.e the I/O work, and let say it take 1.2 secs
R1 is holding the single thread for about very few seconds 0.00001sec 
In the meantime the sigle thread gets unblocked.. so it is being blocked only for  0.00001sec 
and R2 also comes single thread does the synchronous work it the  creates C++ thread for aysnc  work
In the meantime the Response of R1 request will come after 1.2 secs , at the clients end loading 
will show at the client page , the loading time includes internet latency , 
fetching data server for I/O work take a bit of as it is involved multiple operations..

single thread does the CPU intense work that works very fast and 
single thread can handle several request, here in Nodejs request comes , does the sync work,where it uses
minimal resources unlike the traditional servers where multiple threads need to be made
and if the single thread seems new C++ thread should be made , it makes ,and C++ thread is very light 
,as it work with OS , it is fast also

Non-blocking is lik not blocking the the main thread i.e the main thread , for the desired work i.e asyn work
it is spawning the new C++ thread  

Nodejs Server make the C++ thread out of the box which which I dont have to write 

OS code is written in C++..Every harware systems read and write in Assembly language ..
And just above the assesmbly , C++ layer is being put on , which makes the OS work fast ,
C++ is fast pograming language
